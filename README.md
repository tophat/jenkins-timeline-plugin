# Overview

Jenkins Timeline Plugin

Jenkins TL is a jenkins plugin that allows users to gain knowledge about the execution of their builds.


## Motivation

Using the jenkins timeline we are able to identify sequential and paralell steps in a pipeline. This plugins gives us awareness and intuition about how long each step takes as well as what steps would have the most impact if optimized.
